Well this project is about three websites that I created using html. There are too many things that I've been learning, since I didn't know nothing about programming, this websites are about three recipes (Fish Tacos, Vegetarian Minestrone Soup and Spanish Beef Stew). I will say there are a lot to learn and I'm gonna give my best to succeed in this project. Thanks to the Odin Project and all the people that are giving support to this project.
